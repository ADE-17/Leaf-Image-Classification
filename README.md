# PlantLeaf - AI-Leaf-Disease-Classification

# Description
PlantLeaf is a deep learning model developed using fine-tuned AlexNet architecture. The model is designed to accurately identify and classify plant diseases based on images of leaves. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques and addressing class imbalance, the model achieves high accuracy, reaching 92%.

The project aims to assist farmers and researchers in early detection of plant diseases, contributing to improved crop yield and agricultural productivity. Timely identification and treatment can significantly reduce the threat posed by plant diseases, ensuring global food security.
